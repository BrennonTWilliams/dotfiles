        ## STOP - Please Read

        **For security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT use this public issue template.**

        Instead, report security vulnerabilities privately using GitHub's Security Advisory feature:

        **[Report a Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/BrennonTWilliams/dotfiles/security/advisories/new)**

        This ensures the vulnerability is not publicly disclosed before a fix is available.

        See our [Security Policy](https://github.com/BrennonTWilliams/dotfiles/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for details.
